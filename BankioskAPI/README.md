# BankioskAPI
This branch contrains the controllers and models to access to the azure storage
On one side, the controller gets requests from a link and then call a model to process this request.
On the other side, the model is connected with an azure storage using the Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Table.Storage class then it can retreive or post data from it.

# Swagger
